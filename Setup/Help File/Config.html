The configuration dialog allows you to set the parameters of the disk benchmarking process.<BR><BR>

<B>Disk Drive:</B><BR>
Allows you to select the disk drive to benchmark. You can also type in a path, such as to a network share to more-or-less benchmark the speed of the connection.<BR><BR>

<B>Chunk Size:</B><BR>
The chunk size allows you to specify how much data will be written to the test file at one time.<BR><BR>

<B>IOs:</B><BR>
The IOs specifies how many times the chunk size will be written to the test file. Example: If you select a 64 KB chunk size and 1024 IOs the resulting test file will be 64 MB, meaning that the test will be comprised of writing a 64 MB file, 64K at a time in 1,024 loops. The resulting file will also be used for the read test.<BR><BR>

<B>Iterations:</B><BR>
The iterations allows you to set how many times the benchmark will be run. Each iterations will allow DiskMark to average the performance of each IO, so a higher value (25 - 200 iterations) provides more accurate results.<BR><BR>

<B>Allow Intermediate Caching:</B><BR>
When this option is selected, DiskMark will allow windows to use any available caches and to perform lazy writes. Selecting this option WILL increase performance but should remain unchecked when you want to check the speed of the drive alone.<BR><BR>
